## What is Nyano?

Nyano (ticker NYANO, symbol ɏ) is a "pseudo-cryptocurrency", which exists as a subunit of the Nano cryptocurrency
(ticker XNO, symbol Ӿ). It is similar to Bitcoin's Satoshi (SAT) unit, or Nano's even smaller RAW unit.

More specifically:

**1 XNO = 1,000,000 NYANO**  
or  
**Ӿ1 = ɏ1,000,000**

While technically being a subunit of Nano, Nyano has an entire ecosystem of wallet apps, faucets, games, etc separate
from that of Nano. The goal is to eventually get exchanges to list it separately from Nano (XNO).

## Why was Nyano created?

Nyano was created by a group of Nano enthusiasts in order to bring more fun, creativity, and yes, memes, to the Nano 
community. While Nano focuses on becoming the world's most efficient digital currency, Nyano aims to help bring more 
awareness, fun, and excitement to Nano through social channels and adorable Nyano Cats.

## What is Nyano NOT?

* Nyano is NOT a fork (or clone) of Nano, unlike it's sister-project Banano (BAN)
* Nyano is NOT a new cryptocurrency
* Nyano is NOT a token
